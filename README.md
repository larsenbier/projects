# Regression Analysis of Housing Prices - Kaggle Competition
**Project:** Analyzing what factors influence housing prices and building a gradient boosted decision tree to predict housing prices from the [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanknecrothapa/ames-housing-dataset).
* Performed extensive data imputation by analyzing the dataset features.
* Created seaborn and matplotlib visualizations to aid in exploratory data analysis and transforming the data.
* Built an XGBoost decision tree and performed extensive hyperparameter tuning, cross-validating over 5000 combinations of 6 different hyperparameters using random search over a carefully selected hyperparameter space.
